        <img src="../img/Vi_0.jpg" alt="The piltover Enforcer"/>
        <p>Once a criminal from the mean streets of Zaun, Vi is a hotheaded, impulsive, and fearsome woman with only a very loose respect for authority figures.</p>
        <p>Growing up all but alone, Vi developed finely honed survival instincts as well as a wickedly abrasive sense of humor. Now working with the Wardens of Piltover to keep the peace, she wields mighty hextech gauntlets that can punch through walls and suspects with equal ease.</p>

                    <li>Blast Shield -Vi charges a shield over time. The shield can be activated by hitting an enemy with an ability.</li>

                    <li>Vault Breaker -Vi charges her gauntlets and unleashes a vault shattering punch, carrying her forward. Enemies she hits are knocked back and receive a stack of Denting Blows.</li>
